Now you can use LittleJohn at its fullest and you'll quickly learn how easy it is to interact with the DApp since it has been designed to be a one-click trading experience. Just select the currency you'd like to buy or sell then enter the amount in the form, the price will reflect the current rate at which you'll trade your currency, then click 'TRADE'. Your Binance Wallet will pop up asking to confirm a transaction and you should click 'Approve' in order to perform a trade. That's it, you will get fiat tokens in your wallet as you can confirm in your new balance.

Once you get your currencies you can send them to any person or business that takes fiat currencies as these tokens are backed by every single BNB traded for them. If you decide to sell your currencies then do the opposite transaction, sell your fiat and get BNB at market price. We collect 1% fee on every transaction for site maintenance and hosting costs.
